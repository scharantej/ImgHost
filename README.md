**Flask Application Design**

**HTML Files:**

1. **index.html:**
   - This is the main page of the application. It will contain a form that lets the user upload an image file.
   - The form should include a file input field, a submit button, and a status message area to display the processing result.

2. **result.html:**
   - This page displays the image uploaded by the user and the heading generated by Gemini.

**Routes:**

1. **/upload:**
   - This route handles the file upload request.
   - It receives the uploaded image file and passes it to Gemini for processing.
   - Once the heading is generated, it redirects to the result page, passing the generated heading as a parameter.

2. **/result:**
   - This route renders the result page with the uploaded image and the generated heading.

**Additional Notes:**

- The application should use a template engine such as Jinja2 to render the HTML files.
- The user should be authenticated before they can upload an image, and the application should implement measures to prevent unauthorized uploads.
- The application should handle file size limits and invalid file types.
- The application should provide a way for the user to delete uploaded images.
- The application should display error messages to the user when any issues occur during the upload or processing.
